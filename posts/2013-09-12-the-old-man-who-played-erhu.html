        <p>It was 3:30 in the afternoon when I got out of the client’s office. Since there was nothing scheduled after that, I was not in a hurry, and decided to stroll through a park to get to the subway station. It was a detour, but that would give some times to relax after a whole day of meeting.</p>
<p>As I passed through the park, I heard some squeaking sound, which I recognized as from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erhu">erhu</a>, a Chinese two-string musical instrument. I turned around, saw an old man play erhu under a pavillion.</p>
<p>Since I had all my times for the rest of the afternoon, I decided to walk over to take a look.</p>
<p>He was so focused on his instrument. After a long while, he finally raised his head, and was surprised to see me standing there. He was a little embarrased, and sheepishly said: “It so bad, right?” I politely responded: “Not that bad, your music has character.”</p>
<p>We chit-chatted for a while, and from that, I learned that after he retired from a technician position at a textile mill a few years ago, his health deteriorated very quickly. His doctor prescribed him to pick up a hobby. He suddenly remembered that he always wanted to learn to play erhu when he was a boy, but his family could neither afford to buy him the instrument, nor pay for musical lessons.</p>
<p>Now, he was trying to learn the dream music instrument of his childhood. However, his wife and neighbors could not stand the chicken-throat-slitting sound that he made, he had to come practice in the park, when everyone else was working.</p>
<p>I left after some other small talks, but was happy to learn that his health has significantly improved since he started to play music.</p>
<p>Hopefully, some day, he would become a good erhu musician, and have a long life.</p>
