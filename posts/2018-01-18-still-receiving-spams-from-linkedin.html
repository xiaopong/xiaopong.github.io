        <p>Someone invited me to LinkedIn in 2007, I believe. I set up an account, and over the following five years, my list of connections gradually grew. One day, out of the blue, I look at my connections, and I had close to 1000!</p>
<p>1000 ‘friends’!</p>
<p>I was scratching my head, how did I know all these people? Incredulous, I browsed through the list quickly, and realized that I had never met, and not even had a real online conversation with, the majority of these people. I’ve gone blindly accepting invitations after invitations. I was wondering how did I get all these invitations, until I looked at the list of ‘friends recommendation’ sent by LinkedIn, I understood this is probably how people sent out invitation to people whom they had never met nor talked to. And looking at the way LinkedIn recommend friends and acquaintances, I seriously thought that some day, every person on LinkedIn would be connected to everyone else.</p>
<p>I gradually lost interest in LinkedIn. I logged in, probably three to four times a year. I still received invitations from people I don’t know, but I stopped accepting them. As to the existing connections, I was torn. Should I <em>unfriend</em> them, or should I leave them at that?</p>
<p>Suddenly unfriending someone seemed rude, so I decided to ignore them, until 2016, when I started to receive spams via LinkedIn. I logged in, and trimmed down my list of connections to around 200 or so. But I still had no new interest for the platform.</p>
<p>Starting in 2017, the volume of spams from LinkedIn gradually picked up. By mid 2017, I received, almost on daily basis, over two dozens emails from different people and companies I had never heard of, let alone having any business with.</p>
<p>Unsubscribing from any email interest did nothing at all. LinkedIn seemed to ignore any request to unsubscribe. The spams kept flooding in.</p>
<p>In October, I logged in to see what’s going on, and to my surprise, my home page was full of announcements from companies I did not know. I found that I had ‘followed’ close to 400 companies. I did not know how. I did not remember I had followed any company at all. I am a person who despise personality cult, so I do not <em>follow</em>, per the meaning of the term used in general social media.</p>
<p>Naively, I went on to unfollow them, one by one, as I could not figure how to unfollow in batch. Every unfollow operation took at least three clicks, it wasted quite a bit of time, as the heavy pages were loading slowly.</p>
<p>After having unfollowed 20 companies or so, something stroke me: why am I wasting my life doing this shit? The next question that followed, quite naturally, was what do I use LinkedIn for? In the last four years, I seldom looked at it anyway, and for the whole ten years I had been on LinkedIn, I have not done any business via that platform.</p>
<p>So, I was sitting there, staring at that screen, while sipping my tea. Five minutes later, the first string I typed in a search engine page was ‘how to delete LinkedIn account’. Within two minutes, I had my account zapped. For this, we had to give credit to LinkedIn’s team to make closing an account hassle-free.</p>
<p>The platform informed me that it would take about a month for the data to sync between the servers. In the months that followed, I saw the spams gradually subside, but they still trickled in.</p>
<p>Even now, it’s not totally cleared yet. Amazing. But my email account is a much quieter place.</p>
