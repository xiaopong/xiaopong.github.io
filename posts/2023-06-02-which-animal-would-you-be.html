        <p>Recently, I was asked the following question: If you were an animal, which animal would you be?</p>
<p>I would say a dragonfly, if an insect could also be considered an animal. As someone who grew up on the country side, I had always been fascinated by dragonflies. The dragonfly nymph is really ugly, it looks like a little monster if you look closely. But through its own metamorphosis, it becomes a really elegant flying machine.</p>
<p>So, regardless of the background you have, the environment you were born in, through you own hard work, you can metamorphose yourself into something as elegant as a dragonfly.</p>
