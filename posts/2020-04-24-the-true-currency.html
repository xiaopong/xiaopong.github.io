        <p>The series on CBC called Still Standing are about, according to its tagline, Canadians small “towns that are against the ropes but still hanging in there”, and how they overcome struggles.</p>
<p>I have not watched the whole series, I would normally pick one episode in random. Tonight, also by random, just watched an old episode on Lytton BC, and one of the folks had this little gem which, I thought, is very pertinent to share at this point:</p>
<p>The true currency in life is not the dollars, it’s the trust. Trust in humanity and trust in future, that is.</p>
