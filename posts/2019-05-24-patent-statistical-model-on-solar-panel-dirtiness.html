        <p>As I have written in a previous post, I was working with a client company that develops robotic systems to clean up solar panels. I was responsible for designing and implementing the algorithm to detect the dustiness level of the panels, and determine if it is worth cleaning up or not.</p>
<p>We have done some great works there, and have applied for a few patents in China in 2017. Yesterday, we received the notification that one of the patents Iâ€™ve written has been issued.</p>
<p>That patent used a statistical model to compute the dustiness score of the solar panels, which will be fed into the decision making component of the management system.</p>
<p>That was fun.</p>
