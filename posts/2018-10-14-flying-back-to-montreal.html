        <p>Today marks our last day in Shanghai. Since moving here in February 2003, we had been living in this giant city for the last fifteen and half years, witnessing the metamorphozing of the metropolis and the incredible transformation of the whole country.</p>
<p>We have had our ups and downs, and at the end, lost all our savings here, but the experience was an incredible journey. Have we ever felt any regret germinate in our heart? I canâ€™t say for sure, maybe ask me again on my last day on Earth.</p>
<p>It is with some sadness to leave, we really love living here, but as the Chinese old proverb says, no party lasts forever.</p>
<p>Time to board the airplane. Good bye, Shanghai!</p>
