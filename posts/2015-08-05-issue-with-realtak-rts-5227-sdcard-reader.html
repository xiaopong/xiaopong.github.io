        <p>Just got a new Lenovo Thinkpad X250 laptop last month, the first thing to do was to format the disk, got rid off Windows and installed Debian 8.1. The only extra thing I needed to do was to install the <code>iwlwifi</code> firmware, and everything just worked. Well, almost, since I haven’t had time to play with the fingerprint scanner yet.</p>
<p>Over the course of the month, I ran <code>apt-get upgrade</code> twice, for security update. Everything seemed ok, until today, when I inserted an SD card to look up something. Nothing came up. I looked at the system log, not even a single event. It was as if the card reader never detected any insertion.</p>
<p>I took a look at the hardware status, <code>sudo lspci -v</code> showed:</p>
<pre><code>02:00.0 Unassigned class [ff00]: Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd. RTS5227 PCI Express Card Reader (rev 01)

<p>Hmm, it looked like the module is not even loaded. What’s up? Let’s take a look at <code>dmesg</code>:</p>
<pre><code>[    1.315456] usbcore: registered new interface driver hub

<p>Hmm, the module <code>rtsx_pci</code> failed to load, <code>with error -110</code>. This is funny, I’m very sure that the card reader was working flawlessly many times before, across multiple boot sessions. I have a couple of encrypted SD cards to store personal stuffs, and I had used them many times on this laptop. Something went wrong along one of the updates.</p>
<p>Browsing through the kernel bugzilla showed a few cases which had the same error code, and it seemed to be related to the <code>msi_en</code> option. Well, let’s try to work around by disabling that. We need to unload the module first, because of its half-baked state:</p>
<pre><code>sudo modprobe -r rtsx_pci</code></pre>
<p>Then, load it again, with the option disabled:</p>
<pre><code>sudo modprobe rtsx_pci msi_en=0</code></pre>
<p>Now, the system log showed:</p>
<pre><code>[ 5234.004011] rtsx_pci 0000:02:00.0: rtsx_pci_acquire_irq: pcr-&gt;msi_en = 0, pci-&gt;irq = 16</code></pre>
<p>Ok, it seems to be loaded. Let’s look at the status again, the command <code>sudo lspci -v</code> showed:</p>
<pre><code>02:00.0 Unassigned class [ff00]: Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd. RTS5227 PCI Express Card Reader (rev 01)
        Subsystem: Lenovo Device 2226
        Flags: bus master, fast devsel, latency 0, IRQ 16
        Memory at f1100000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=4K]
        Capabilities: [40] Power Management version 3
        Capabilities: [50] MSI: Enable- Count=1/1 Maskable- 64bit+
        Capabilities: [70] Express Endpoint, MSI 00

        Capabilities: [150] Latency Tolerance Reporting
        Capabilities: [158] L1 PM Substates
        Kernel driver in use: rtsx_pci</code></pre>
<p>Now, let’s insert an SD card into the slot, and look at system log, we got:</p>
<pre><code>Aug  9 15:35:23 venus kernel: [ 5280.782622] mmc0: new high speed SDHC card at address aaaa
Aug  9 15:35:23 venus kernel: [ 5280.783923] mmcblk0: mmc0:aaaa SU08G 7.40 GiB
Aug  9 15:35:23 venus kernel: [ 5280.797583]  mmcblk0: p1 p2</code></pre>
<p>Bingo, now the card has been detected, and devices are created properly. All we have to do is to mount it.</p>
<p>To keep the module option across reboot sessions, create a file <code>/etc/modprobe.d/rtsx_pci.conf</code> and add the following line:</p>
<pre><code>options rtsx_pci msi_en=0</code></pre>
<p>Rebooted and it still worked!</p>
