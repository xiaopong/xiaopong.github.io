        <p>A big tsunami, carrying a big wave, was rushing to the shore. A kid was hit first. He struggled to keep his head above water, while paddling with all the strength of his arms. A few other kids nearby were running for for high ground.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, on the shore, a bunch of fat kids were jeering at the drowning kid, saying that he paddled it wrong. As other kids ran by and yelled at the fat kits to take refuge, some fat kits anxiously looked up at the fattest of the bunch for direction on what to do next. The biggest and fattest kid patted them on the back: “We will be fine. We are fat, unlike him, we will float. And we all have life buoy, do we not?” Barely had he finished his sentence that a big wave smashed on their head, and they were now all under water.</p>
<p>Miraculously, through determination and grit, the first kid has now reached the dry land, and running to take refuge on high ground.</p>
<p>The fattest kid, in between gasps of breadth, complained that the first kid was playing foul, by not notifying him of the intensity of the wave.</p>
