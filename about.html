            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>I am a computer programmer. Some would prefer the more pompous title of software engineer, but programming seems to reflect the reality of our work better.</p>
<p>I have worked on telecom switches, content management systems, financial trading systems, e-payment platforms, large internet platforms, robotic systems, etc. I work mostly on the server side.</p>
<p>I do, and have worked with in the past, Java, Scala, Haskell, Erlang, Rust, C/C++, Ada. Whenever possible, I prefer to work with strongly typed programming languages, especially for large projects.</p>
<p>In my spare time, I love to read, write codes for my own experimenting, painting, and play a little music (I am a very lousy musician).</p>
